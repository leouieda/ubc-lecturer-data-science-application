\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee:}

I am writing to apply for the position of Lecturer in the Masters of Data
Science Program of the University of British Columbia, as advertised on the
website of the Department of Statistics.
I am currently visiting research scholar at the University of Hawai'i in the
Department of Geology and Geophysics.
My research interests include geophysical inverse problems, scientific
software development, and geospatial data visualization.

% Research and OSS
My research training is in the development of methods and algorithms for
solving geophysical inverse problems.
The methods that I have created are computationally efficient
solutions to the problem of estimating subsurface density variations
from observation of disturbances in the Earth's gravity field (e.g., Uieda and
Barbosa, 2012, 2017).
Recently, I have been interested in the application of machine learning and
data science techniques to geophysical datasets
(e.g., Uieda and Barbosa, 2017, and Uieda and Wessel, 2018;
\href{https://github.com/leouieda/aogs2018-gps}{github.com/leouieda/aogs2018-gps}).
I intend to continue my research program in the intersection of geophysics and
data science and would welcome collaborations with the Data Science Lab.
I would also use this opportunity to establish a relationship the members of
the UBC Geophysical Inversion Facility.

Simultaneously, I have created open-source software to support my research and
teaching in the form of the Python library \textit{Fatiando a Terra}
(\href{http://www.fatiando.org/}{www.fatiando.org}).
The project uses software development best practices, such as version control
and the Github pull request workflow
(\href{https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando}{github.com/fatiando/fatiando}),
automated tests and continuous integration,
and packaging and distribution through the Python Package Index and
conda-forge.
My current work at the University of Hawai'i is to develop a Python wrapper
library for the \textit{Generic Mapping Tools}
(GMT; \href{http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/}{gmt.soest.hawaii.edu}),
an open-source software packaged widely used across the Earth, Atmospheric, and
Ocean Sciences to process and visualize geospatial data.
I have also contributed to other open-source projects, all of which can be
accessed through my Github profile
\href{https://github.com/leouieda/}{github.com/leouieda}.

As a proponent of open and reproducible science, I publish all of the
source-code and data for my first author publications through my research
group's Github page
(\href{https://github.com/pinga-lab}{github.com/pinga-lab}).
To help promote reproducible research best practices within the group,
I maintain a template
(\href{https://github.com/pinga-lab/paper-template}{github.com/pinga-lab/paper-template})
which is used for creating new projects and experimenting with computational
workflows.

% Teaching

I have three years of teaching experience from my work as Assistant Professor
at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Brazil.
There, I taught undergraduate-level classes on geophysical methods,
introduction to geology, and programming and numerical methods.
I was given the opportunity to design two geophysics courses for the geology
program
(\href{http://www.leouieda.com/teaching/geofisica1.html}{leouieda.com/teaching/geofisica1.html}
and
\href{http://www.leouieda.com/teaching/geofisica2.html}{leouieda.com/teaching/geofisica2.html})
and a programming and numerical methods course for the oceanography
program
(\href{http://www.leouieda.com/teaching/matematica-especial.html}{leouieda.com/teaching/matematica-especial.html}).
All three are based on active learning principals and rely heavily on hands-on
exercises using Jupyter notebooks, numerical simulations, and real world
datasets.
Each class module of the geophysics courses includes a Jupyter notebook with
interactive simulations or real datasets to help guide the students through a
series of formative and summative assessments
(e.g.,
\href{https://github.com/leouieda/geofisica2/blob/master/notebooks/}{github.com/leouieda/geofisica2/blob/master/notebooks}).
The programming course was entirely implemented using Github repositories and
the \href{https://classroom.github.com/}{classroom.github.com} service.
Each module has a repository with a group project containing instructions, a
Jupyter notebook, and data
(\href{https://github.com/mat-esp}{github.com/mat-esp}).
The students submit their work as repositories in a separate Github
organization
(e.g., the projects for the
2016 class are at
\href{https://github.com/mat-esp-2016}{github.com/mat-esp-2016}).
Grading and feedback are provided through Github issues (e.g.,
\href{https://github.com/mat-esp/about/issues/259}{github.com/mat-esp/about/issues/259}).
This workflow allowed me to manage a project-based class with over 70 students
as the sole instructor.
I have also taught short workshops on Python programming and inverse problems
in geophysics.
All of my teaching material is available on Github and on my personal website
\href{http://www.leouieda.com/teaching/}{leouieda.com/teaching}.
Evidence of my public speaking skills is publicly available through my talks at
the Scipy Conference, which have been recorded and uploaded to YouTube (see
\href{http://www.leouieda.com/talks/}{leouieda.com/talks}).


% Conclusion
I look forward to the opportunity to learn from the experience of the MDS
faculty and to share my domain knowledge of geoscience to expand the program.
I am particularly interested in the Capstone project, for which I see great
potential for collaboration with the mining and oil and gas industries.


\closing{Thank you for your consideration,}
